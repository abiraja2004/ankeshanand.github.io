Hi there, I am Ankesh Anand and this is supposed to be my place on the internet.
I am a full-stack developer, and a lover of interesting, relevant and hard problems. 

Broadly I am interested in Software Engineering and Data Science as a whole.I am excited about tech startups and new technologies and my daily web trademill includes TechCrunch, HackerNews, Re-Code, Quora and Reddit.
Quizzing, Tennis and Arsenal keep me busy when I am not programming.

This blog would contain my musings on programming in general, but it should not be a surprise if I wander off.
