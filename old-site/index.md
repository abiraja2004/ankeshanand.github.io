Hi, I am Ankesh Anand. I study Mathematics and Computing at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) and expect to graduate in May '16.

I am currently working as a Python / Django engineering intern at [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/).
Previously, I was an intern at [Google Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014) with [BRL-CAD](http://brlcad.org).
